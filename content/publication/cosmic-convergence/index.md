abstract: This note discusses some aspects of the asymptotic behaviour of nonexpansive maps. Using metric functionals, we make a connection to the invariant subspace problem and prove a new result for nonexpansive maps of {{< math >}}$\ell_{1}${{< /math >}}. We also point out some inaccurate assertions appearing in the literature on this topic.
