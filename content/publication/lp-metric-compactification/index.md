abstract: The notion of metric compactification was introduced by Gromov and later rediscovered by Rieffel. It has been mainly studied on proper geodesic metric spaces. We present here a generalization of the metric compactification that can be applied to infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Thereafter we give a complete description of the metric compactification of infinite-dimensional {{< math >}}$\ell_p${{< /math >}} spaces for all {{< math >}}$1 \leq p < \infty${{< /math >}}. We also give a full characterization of the metric compactification of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
