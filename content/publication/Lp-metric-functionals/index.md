abstract: We present a complete characterization of the metric compactification of {{< math >}}$L_p${{< /math >}} spaces for {{< math >}}$1 \leq p < \infty${{< /math >}}. Each element of the metric compactification of {{< math >}}$L_p${{< /math >}} is represented by a random measure on a certain Polish space. By way of illustration, we revisit the {{< math >}}$L_p${{< /math >}}-mean ergodic theorem for {{< math >}}$1 < p < \infty${{< /math >}}, and Alspachâ€™s example of an isometry on a weakly compact convex subset of {{< math >}}$L_1${{< /math >}} with no fixed points.
